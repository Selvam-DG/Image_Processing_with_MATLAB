### Course Outline
- Working with Image Data
  - Import, visualize, and extract information from different image types and image data types.
- Preprocessing
  - Preprocess images to improve algorithms.
    - Enhancing contrast
    - Noise removal techniques
    - Block processing
    - Quality metrics

- Color Segmentation
  - Use color spaces, regions of interest, and the Color Thresholder app to segment images based on color.

- Texture Segmentation
  - Analyze texture within images for segmentation.

- Improving Segmentations
  - Refine your segmentation with morphological operations. Automate segmentation from a seed mask using iterative techniques.

- Finding and Analyzing Objects
  - Separate overlapping objects in your segmentation. Label objects and measure their properties, such as area and perimeter.

- Detecting Edges and Shapes
  - Detect edges of objects and identify lines and circles in an image.

- Batch Processing
  - Process large numbers of files using the Image Batch Processor app and image datastores.

- Aligning Images with Image Registration
  - Register images using phase correlation, control points, and feature matching.
