#### Detecting Edges
- Edges in images are areas with strong intensity contrasts‚Äîa jump in intensity from one pixel to the next
- The edge function
  - You can use the edge function to detect the boundaries of objects in a grayscale or binary image.
  - BW = edge(I,method,threshold)
- Edge detection using the Sobel method
  - By default, edge uses the Sobel method. This method uses intensity gradients to find edges. Regions that have a gradient magnitude, G, above a threshold are identified as edges.
- locate the edges of well-defined objects in a grayscale image by calling the edge function without specifying a threshold.
  - defaultEdges = edge(gs)

- Detecting edges with the Canny method
  - The Canny method detects weak edges if they are connected to a strong edge. Consider the grayscale image on the left with a tall rectangle and three squares. Three edges are marked with blue, red, and yellow lines.
  - The Canny algorithm applies two thresholds to the gradient: a high threshold for strong edges and a low threshold for weak edges. The edge function starts with the strong edges and then grows them to include weak edges that are connected.

-  find the edges of connected objects in the binary image using bwboundaries.
  - boundaries = bwboundaries(BW)
- find out by visualizing the boundaries on top of the original image.
  - visboundaries(boundaries)

#### Detecting Circles
- Start by finding the positions of the coins using the imfindcircles function.
  - [centers,radii] = imfindcircles(I,[rmin rmax])
- To extract the subset of the radii based on the logical index variable, idxd, you can use logical indexing.
  - r(idxd)
  - The centers have two dimensions and you need to extract both.
    - c(idxd,:)

#### Detecting Lines
- The Hough transform starts by searching the binary image for a true value.
- At each true value, the transform identifies straight lines that pass through that position. Each line is defined in terms of an angle, ùúÉ, and distance to the upper left corner, ùúå. These coordinates are incremented in the Hough transform matrix by +1.
- This process is repeated for each true value in the binary mask, creating overlapping sine curves.
- By identifying the peaks in the Hough transform, you can identify the lines that exist in the image.
